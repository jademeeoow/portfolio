        <p>
          I’m a dedicated back-end developer with strong experience in building
          systems that are reliable and easy to grow. I enjoy solving problems
          and writing code that helps systems run smoothly. Outside of work, I
          love gaming and have good skills in Dota, Mobile Legends, and Clash of
          Clans. I’m confident in what I do, which helps me overcome challenges
          and keep getting better in both my work and hobbies.
